## Data Cleaning Process
Before analyzing the seller data, we ensured data quality and consistency through the following steps in Tableau Prep:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: 
   - Missing data points were either imputed or removed if extensive, to avoid bias in the analysis.

2. **Data Standardization**: 
   - Key fields such as `sellerproductcount`, `Positive Rating Percentage`, and `Hero product ratings` were standardized for consistency.

3. **String Extraction and Conversion**:
   - Extracted numerical values from text fields (e.g., `sellerproductcount`) and converted necessary fields to appropriate data types (e.g., integers, percentages).

4. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Aggregated data at the seller level to create a summary table, accurately representing each sellerâ€™s performance metrics.
